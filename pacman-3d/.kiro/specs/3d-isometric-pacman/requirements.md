# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a 3D isometric Pacman game featuring high-quality graphics, smooth keyboard controls, and modern 3D rendering. The game will provide a fresh take on the classic Pacman experience by presenting the familiar maze gameplay from an isometric perspective with enhanced visual fidelity and responsive controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control Pacman using arrow keys with smooth movement, so that I can navigate the maze intuitively and responsively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses and holds an arrow key THEN Pacman SHALL move continuously in that direction until the key is released or an obstacle is encountered
2. WHEN the player releases an arrow key THEN Pacman SHALL stop moving in that direction
3. WHEN the player presses a different arrow key while moving THEN Pacman SHALL change direction smoothly without stopping
4. WHEN Pacman encounters a wall or boundary THEN the system SHALL prevent further movement in that direction while allowing movement in other valid directions
5. WHEN the player presses multiple arrow keys simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recently pressed key

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to experience the game in a 3D isometric view with high-quality graphics, so that I can enjoy a visually appealing and modern version of the classic game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL render the maze in an isometric 3D perspective
2. WHEN displaying game elements THEN the system SHALL use high-quality 3D models and textures for Pacman, ghosts, pellets, and maze walls
3. WHEN rendering the scene THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth frame rates (minimum 60 FPS) during gameplay
4. WHEN displaying the maze THEN the system SHALL provide proper depth perception and visual hierarchy through lighting and shadows
5. WHEN the camera is positioned THEN it SHALL provide a clear view of the entire playable area from an optimal isometric angle

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to collect pellets and power pellets in the maze, so that I can score points and gain temporary advantages over the ghosts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Pacman moves over a regular pellet THEN the system SHALL remove the pellet and increase the player's score by 10 points
2. WHEN Pacman moves over a power pellet THEN the system SHALL remove the power pellet, increase the score by 50 points, and activate power mode
3. WHEN power mode is active THEN ghosts SHALL become vulnerable and change appearance for 10 seconds
4. WHEN all pellets are collected THEN the system SHALL advance to the next level
5. WHEN pellets are collected THEN the system SHALL play appropriate sound effects and visual feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to encounter AI-controlled ghosts that chase me through the maze, so that I can experience challenging and engaging gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL spawn four ghosts with distinct colors and behaviors
2. WHEN ghosts are in normal mode THEN they SHALL actively pursue Pacman using pathfinding algorithms
3. WHEN ghosts are in vulnerable mode THEN they SHALL flee from Pacman and move more slowly
4. WHEN Pacman collides with a ghost in normal mode THEN the system SHALL end the current life and respawn Pacman
5. WHEN Pacman collides with a vulnerable ghost THEN the system SHALL remove the ghost temporarily and award bonus points

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my current score, lives remaining, and level information, so that I can track my progress and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL display the current score prominently on screen
2. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL show the number of lives remaining
3. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL display the current level number
4. WHEN the score changes THEN the display SHALL update immediately with smooth animations
5. WHEN a life is lost or gained THEN the lives display SHALL update with appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to have proper collision detection and physics, so that the gameplay feels accurate and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Pacman moves through the maze THEN the system SHALL prevent movement through walls and boundaries
2. WHEN Pacman approaches a corner THEN the system SHALL allow smooth turning if the path is clear
3. WHEN objects interact THEN the system SHALL detect collisions accurately within 1 pixel tolerance
4. WHEN Pacman moves THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth movement without stuttering or clipping
5. WHEN the game runs THEN the physics system SHALL maintain consistent behavior across different frame rates

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want audio feedback and background music, so that I can have an immersive gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL play background music that loops continuously
2. WHEN Pacman collects a pellet THEN the system SHALL play a distinct collection sound
3. WHEN Pacman enters power mode THEN the system SHALL play a power-up sound and change the background music
4. WHEN Pacman loses a life THEN the system SHALL play a death sound effect
5. WHEN audio plays THEN the system SHALL support volume control and muting options
