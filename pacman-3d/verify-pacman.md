# Pacman Implementation Verification

## Task 4 Completion Checklist

### ✅ Create Pacman class extending GameObject base class
- [x] Created `GameObject.ts` base class with position, rotation, scale, and mesh management
- [x] Created `Pacman.ts` class extending GameObject
- [x] Implemented proper inheritance and method overrides

### ✅ Generate 3D Pacman model using SphereGeometry with mouth animation
- [x] Created Pacman body using `THREE.SphereGeometry` with yellow material
- [x] Added mouth geometry using `THREE.ConeGeometry` for mouth opening effect
- [x] Implemented mouth animation with opening/closing based on movement
- [x] Added proper shadow casting and material properties

### ✅ Implement basic position-based movement on maze grid
- [x] Grid-based position system using `THREE.Vector2` for grid coordinates
- [x] Direction handling with current and next direction vectors
- [x] Movement validation against maze walls using `maze.isWall()`
- [x] Proper coordinate conversion between grid and world space

### ✅ Add smooth interpolation between grid positions for fluid movement
- [x] Interpolation system using `interpolationProgress` (0 to 1)
- [x] Smooth movement between grid positions using `Vector2.lerpVectors()`
- [x] Configurable movement speed (4 grid units per second)
- [x] Proper timing using delta time for frame-rate independent movement

### ✅ Create simple movement animation with mouth opening/closing
- [x] Mouth animation using sine wave for oscillating movement
- [x] Mouth visibility control (hidden when not moving)
- [x] Rotation animation to face movement direction
- [x] Configurable animation speed and mouth opening angle

### ✅ Integration with GameEngine and Input System
- [x] Added Pacman to GameEngine initialization
- [x] Integrated keyboard input handling (Arrow keys)
- [x] Added update loop integration for movement and animation
- [x] Proper resource disposal and cleanup

### ✅ Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 1.1**: ✅ Arrow key controls implemented with continuous movement
**Requirement 1.4**: ✅ Wall collision detection prevents movement through obstacles  
**Requirement 6.4**: ✅ Smooth movement without stuttering or clipping

## Manual Testing Instructions

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:3002/`
3. Use arrow keys to move Pacman around the maze
4. Verify:
   - Pacman appears as a yellow sphere in the maze
   - Arrow keys control movement in all four directions
   - Pacman cannot move through blue walls
   - Movement is smooth and interpolated between grid positions
   - Mouth opens and closes while moving
   - Pacman rotates to face movement direction
   - Movement stops when releasing keys or hitting walls

## Key Features Implemented

1. **3D Model**: SphereGeometry-based Pacman with animated mouth
2. **Grid Movement**: Position-based movement system on maze grid
3. **Smooth Animation**: Interpolated movement between grid positions
4. **Collision Detection**: Wall collision prevention using maze data
5. **Input Handling**: Arrow key controls with direction queuing
6. **Visual Effects**: Mouth animation and rotation based on movement
7. **Performance**: Efficient update loop with delta time calculations

The implementation successfully fulfills all requirements for Task 4 and provides a solid foundation for the next tasks in the implementation plan.
